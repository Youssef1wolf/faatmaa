    <h2>i don't know what to say or how to start but, i'm not okay without you it's the first time to feel like that i realy love you and i was talking with someone told me something and while i was thinking at what he say it really hurt me more , just imagin that you will be with someone else killing me,we didn't talk for while but you didn't leave me, you was with me at my dreams i wasn't want to wake up to not leave you we were happy and laughing and hugging , i feel it's not just my word make you fell that i feel that there something else , there many questions in my head , we got crushed with the first rock hit us , i feel there something with you and i tried to call you but i didn't , the first time i felt this feeling that i'm afraid , and it wasn't just i miss you i miss missing you , also the reason that make me have two thought after all that you not have the same feelings that i have, but you know even what happened i will not forget you and at the darkest point at my heart it will always be for you it will always belongs to you , you could forget me for the rest of my life , and i still remember you untill my last breath , and i remember i asked you before about if something happened to me and you need me to remember us what you will say , you said you will tell me about the day after ALAID prayer , so if you saw this that you mean that you choose yes and i really want to back again together .
